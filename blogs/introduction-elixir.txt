Introduction to Elixir
 

For the past few years, I have been consulting with the wonderful folks over at Solution Street on a couple of projects for their customers. Recently, I was invited to the Solution Street office to give an introduction to a new programming language called Elixir.

Elixir is a functional programming language that runs on the BEAM, which is the standard Erlang virtual machine in use today. Erlang was created by Ericsson in 1986 to power telephone switches.  The virtual machine has been designed specifically to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications.

You can watch the presentation on youtube or download just the slides. In the presentation, I start by covering the background of the language, and then quickly move into some live coding for about 40 minutes.

Here are some resources if you are interested in learning more about Elixir:
