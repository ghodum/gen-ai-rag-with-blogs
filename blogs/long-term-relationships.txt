Long Term Relationships
100% of Solution Street’s clients who worked with us three years ago are still working with us today.  We pride ourselves on relationship management.   We don’t take our clients for granted.  Due to our focus on quality and good listening skills we are able to address our clients’ needs.  All software projects may experience  bumps in the road. We provide continuous  communication, giving our clients a solid comfort level, knowing that they are aware of all accomplishments and, more importantly, all issues.

Our goal is 100% client satisfaction.  Solid experience in the industry and a balanced perspective of technological solutions with a business management focus gives us the edge we need to make our clients happy.  We would like to continue this trend with our new and prospective clients.
