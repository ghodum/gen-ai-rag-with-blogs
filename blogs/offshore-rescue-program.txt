Offshore Rescue Program
After working on dozens of offshore projects over the last 7 years, we've learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t work. Unfortunately, lots of projects that shouldn’t be done offshore are, and businesses are suffering because of it. In addition, projects that can be effectively offshored are suffering from a lack of proper process and discipline. We can help! Over the past year we have rescued 4 different clients from their offshore failures. In some cases we  installed better processes and fixed  poor architectural decisions. In other cases we assisted in bringing the work home. In one case we helped our customer pick a new offshore provider and developed a hybrid model – a logical split between offshore and local work.

Regardless of your situation, we will find a way to fix your flawed offshore projects and restore them to good health. We believe building software should be fun, profitable, fulfilling and empowering. Give us a call, we can help!
